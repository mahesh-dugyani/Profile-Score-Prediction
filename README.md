# 📊 Profile Score Prediction using Machine Learning

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts an applicant’s **Profile Score** based on demographic and financial attributes.  
The project covers the complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using **Streamlit**.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Financial institutions often need to assess applicants efficiently.  
This project uses Machine Learning to predict a **Profile Score**, which can help in evaluating applicant credibility and risk.

The model is trained, evaluated, optimized, and deployed as an interactive web application.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handle missing values and categorical features
- Compare multiple ML algorithms
- Select the best-performing model
- Deploy the model using a user-friendly web interface
- Visualize feature importance for model explainability

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Decision Tree Regressor (CART)** – Final selected model
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Used for performance comparison

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using standard regression metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

📌 The **Decision Tree model** significantly outperformed KNN and was chosen for deployment.

## 🖥️ Web Application (Streamlit)

The deployed Streamlit app includes:

- Clean form-based UI
- Dropdowns for categorical inputs
- Input validation with error messages
- Reset functionality
- Real-time profile score prediction
- Feature importance visualization
